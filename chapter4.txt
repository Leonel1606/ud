Is git checkout the same as git branch?
Git checkout works hand-in-hand with git branch . The git branch command can be used 
to create a new branch. When you want to start a new feature, you create a new branch off main using git branch new_branch . 
Once created you can then use git checkout new_branch to switch to that branch.
